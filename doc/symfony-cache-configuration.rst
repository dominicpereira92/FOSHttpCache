.. _symfony httpcache configuration:

Symfony HttpCache Configuration
-------------------------------

Symfonyâ€™s `HttpKernel`_ component provides a reverse proxy implemented
completely in PHP, called `HttpCache`_. While it is certainly less efficient
than using Varnish or NGINX, it can still provide considerable performance
gains over an installation that is not cached at all. It can be useful for
running an application on shared hosting for instance.

You can use features of this library with the help of event listeners that act
on events of the ``HttpCache``. The Symfony ``HttpCache`` does not have an
event system, for this you need to use the trait ``EventDispatchingHttpCache``
provided by this library. The event listeners handle the requests from the
:doc:`cache invalidator <cache-invalidator>`.

.. note::

    Symfony ``HttpCache`` does not currently provide support for banning.

Using the trait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The trait is available since version 2.0.0. Version 1.* of this library
    instead provided a base ``HttpCache`` class to extend.

Your ``AppCache`` needs to implement ``CacheInvalidation`` and use the
trait ``FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache``::

    // app/AppCache.php

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\CacheInvalidation;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpCache\HttpCache;

    class AppCache extends HttpCache implements CacheInvalidation
    {
        use EventDispatchingHttpCache;

        /**
         * Made public to allow event listeners to do refresh operations.
         *
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        public function fetch(Request $request, $catch = false)
        {
            return parent::fetch($request, $catch);
        }
    }

The trait adds the ``addSubscriber`` and ``addListener`` methods as defined in
the ``EventDispatcherInterface`` to your cache kernel. In addition, it triggers
events before and/or after kernel methods to let the listeners interact. If you
need to overwrite core ``HttpCache`` functionality in your kernel, you can
provide your own event listeners. If you need to implement functionality
directly on the methods, be careful to always call the trait methods rather
than going directly to the parent, or events will not be triggered anymore. You
might also need to copy a method from the trait and add your own logic between
the events to not be too early or too late for the event.

When starting to extend your ``AppCache``, it is recommended to use the
``EventDispatchingHttpCacheTestCase`` to run tests with your kernel to be sure
all events are triggered as expected.

.. note::

    If you use ``HttpKernel::loadClassCache`` from the console, you will need
    to add ``class_exists('FOS\\HttpCache\\SymfonyCache\\CacheEvent');`` right
    after the inclusion of ``bootstrap.php.cache`` in ``app/console``. For web
    requests, this is done automatically by the trait. If you miss to do so,
    you will get the following error:

    .. code-block:: bash

        Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\Event in app/cache/dev/classes.php on line ...

Cache event listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have an event dispatching kernel, you can make it register the
listeners you need. While you could do that from your bootstrap code, this is
not the recommended way. You would need to adjust every place you instantiate
the cache. Instead, overwrite the constructor of your ``AppCache`` and register
the listeners you need there::

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\DebugListener();
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\CustomTtlListener();
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeListener;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\RefreshListener;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\UserContextListener;

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register event listeners for FOSHttpCache.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        StoreInterface $store,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);

        $this->addSubscriber(new CustomTtlListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new PurgeListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new RefreshListener());
        $this->addSubscriber(new UserContextListener());
        if (isset($options['debug']) && $options['debug']) {
            $this->addSubscriber(new DebugListener());
        }
    }

The event listeners can be tweaked by passing options to the constructor. The
Symfony configuration system does not work here because things in the cache
happen before the configuration is loaded.

Purge
~~~~~

To support :ref:`cache invalidation <cache invalidate>`, register the
``PurgeListener``. If the default settings are right for you, you don't
need to do anything more.

Purging is only allowed from the same machine by default. To purge data from
other hosts, provide the IPs of the machines allowed to purge, or provide a
RequestMatcher that checks for an Authorization header or similar. *Only set
one of ``client_ips`` or ``client_matcher``*.

* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  purge the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcherInterface that only matches requests that are
  allowed to purge.

  **default**: ``null``

* **purge_method**: HTTP Method used with purge requests.

  **default**: ``PURGE``

Refresh
~~~~~~~

To support :ref:`cache refresh <cache refresh>`, register the
``RefreshListener``. You can pass the constructor an option to specify
what clients are allowed to refresh cache entries.

The refresh listener needs to access the ``HttpCache::fetch`` method which
is protected on the base HttpCache class. The ``EventDispatchingHttpCache``
exposes the method as public, but if you implement your own kernel, you need
to overwrite the method to make it public.

Refreshing is only allowed from the same machine by default. To refresh from
other hosts, provide the IPs of the machines allowed to refresh, or provide a
RequestMatcher that checks for an Authorization header or similar. *Only set
one of ``client_ips`` or ``client_matcher``*.


* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  refresh the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcher that only matches requests that are
  allowed to refresh.

  **default**: ``null``

Tagging
~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.1

    Support for tag invalidation with Symfony HttpCache has been added in
    version 2.1.

To support :doc:`cache tags <response-tagging>`, register the
``PurgeTagsListener``. For this listener to work, you must use the
:ref:`TaggableStore <taggablestore>` provided in this library, instead of the
default cache implementation.

Purging tags is only allowed from the same machine by default. To change this,
you have the same configuration options as with the ``PurgeListener``. *Only
set one of ``client_ips`` or ``client_matcher``*. Additionally, you can
configure the HTTP method and header used for tag purging:

* **client_ips**: String with IP or array of IPs that are allowed to
  purge the cache.

  **default**: ``127.0.0.1``

* **client_matcher**: RequestMatcherInterface that only matches requests that are
  allowed to purge.

  **default**: ``null``

* **purge_tags_method**: HTTP Method used with purge tags requests.

  **default**: ``PURGETAGS``

* **purge_tags_header**: HTTP Header that contains the comma-separated tags to purge.

  **default**: ``X-Cache-Tags``

To get cache tagging support, register the ``PurgeTagsListener`` and use the
``TaggableStore`` in your ``AppCache``::

    // app/AppCache.php

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\TaggableStore;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeTagsListener;

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register the TaggableStore.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        $store = new TaggableStore(['cache_directory' => $kernel->getCacheDir()]);

        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);

        $this->addSubscriber(new PurgeTagsListener());
    }

.. _taggablestore:

TaggableStore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.1

    The ``TaggableStore`` has been added in version 2.1.

.. note::

    You need at least versions 3.4 of ``symfony/cache`` and ``symfony/lock``
    to use this feature. Add the following lines to your ``composer.json`` and run
    ``composer update``:

        "symfony/lock": "^3.4",
        "symfony/cache": "^3.4",

Symfony's ``HttpCache`` store implementation does not support tags. Therefore,
this library ships with a ``TaggableStore`` that is build on top of PSR-6 to
provide this functionality.

Even if you do not want to invalidate cache entries by tags, you might be
interested in using the ``TaggableStore``, as this store leverages the
functionality of PSR-6 to prune expired cache entries to free up disk space.

By default, the ``TaggableStore`` prunes the cache after a configurable number
of cache write operations. You can disable automatic pruning, e.g. if you set
up a cron job to prune, by setting the option ``prune_threshold`` to ``0``.

Use the ``TaggableStore`` in your ``AppCache``::

    // app/AppCache.php

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\PurgeTagsListener;

    // ...

    /**
     * Overwrite constructor to register the TaggableStore.
     */
    public function __construct(
        HttpKernelInterface $kernel,
        SurrogateInterface $surrogate = null,
        array $options = []
    ) {
        $store = new TaggableStore(['cache_directory' => $kernel->getCacheDir()]);

        parent::__construct($kernel, $store, $surrogate, $options);
    }

The ``TaggableStore`` can be configured by passing an array of ``$options`` as a
second argument:

* **cache_directory**: Path to the cache directory for the default cache
  adapter and lock factory.

  Either this or both cache and lock_factory are required.

  **Type**: ``string``

* **cache**: Explicitly specify the cache adapter you want to use. Make sure
  that lock and cache have the same scope. *See warning below!*

  **Type**: ``Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\TagAwareAdapterInterface``
  **Default**: ``FilesystemAdapter`` instance with cache_directory

* **lock_factory**: Explicitly specify the lock factory you want to use. Make
  sure that lock and cache have the same scope. *See warning below!*

  **Type**: ``Symfony\Component\Lock\Factory``
  **Default**: ``Factory`` with ``SemaphoreStore`` if supported, ``FlockStore`` otherwise

* **prune_threshold**: Configure the number of write actions until the store
  will prune the expired cache entries. Pass 0 to disable automated pruning.

  **Type**: ``int``
  **Default**: 500

* **purge_tags_header**: The HTTP header name used to check for tags

  **Type**: ``string``
  **Default**: ``X-Cache-Tags``

.. warning::

    It is possible to configure other cache adapters or lock stores than the
    filesystem ones. Only do this if you are sure of what you are doing. In
    `this pull request`_ Fabien Potentier refused to add PSR-6 store support to
    the Symfony ``AppCache`` with the following arguments:

        * Using a filesystem allows for ``opcache`` to make the cache very
          effective;
        * The cache contains some PHP (when using ESI for instance) and storing
          PHP in anything else than a filesystem would mean ``eval()``-ing
          strings coming from Redis / Memcache /...;
        * HttpCache is triggered very early and does not have access to the
          container or anything else really. And it should stay that way to be
          efficient.

    While the first and third point depend on what you do and need, be sure to
    respect the second point. If you use network enabled caches like Redis or
    Memcache, make sure that they are not shared with other systems in your
    hosting center to avoid code injection.

.. _symfony-cache user context:

User Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support :doc:`user context hashing <user-context>` you need to register the
``UserContextListener``. The user context is then automatically recognized
based on session cookies or authorization headers. If the default settings are
right for you, you don't need to do anything more. You can customize a number of
options through the constructor:

* **anonymous_hash**: Hard-coded hash to use for anonymous users. This is a
  performance optimization to not do a backend request for users that are not
  logged in. If you specify a non-empty value for this field, that is used as
  context hash header instead of doing a hash lookup for anonymous users.

* **user_hash_accept_header**: Accept header value to be used to request the
  user hash to the backend application. Must match the setup of the backend
  application.

  **default**: ``application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash``

* **user_hash_header**: Name of the header the user context hash will be stored
  into. Must match the setup for the Vary header in the backend application.

  **default**: ``X-User-Context-Hash``

* **user_hash_uri**: Target URI used in the request for user context hash
  generation.

  **default**: ``/_fos_user_context_hash``

* **user_hash_method**: HTTP Method used with the hash lookup request for user
  context hash generation.

  **default**: ``GET``

* **session_name_prefix**: Prefix for session cookies. Must match your PHP session configuration.

  **default**: ``PHPSESSID``

.. warning::

    If you have a customized session name, it is **very important** that this
    constant matches it.
    Session IDs are indeed used as keys to cache the generated use context hash.

    Wrong session name will lead to unexpected results such as having the same
    user context hash for every users, or not having it cached at all, which
    hurts performance.

.. note::

    To use authorization headers for user context, you might have to add some server
    configuration to make these headers available to PHP.

    With Apache, you can do this for example in a ``.htaccess`` file::

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

Cleaning the Cookie Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the UserContextListener only sets the session cookie (according to
the ``session_name_prefix`` option) in the requests to the backend. If you need
a different behavior, overwrite ``UserContextListener::cleanupHashLookupRequest``
with your own logic.

.. _symfonycache_customttl:

Custom TTL
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/custom-ttl.rst

The ``CustomTtlListener`` looks at a specific header to determine the TTL,
preferring that over ``s-maxage``. The default header is ``X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL``
but you can customize that in the listener constructor::

    new CustomTtlListener('My-TTL-Header');

The custom header is removed before sending the response to the client.

.. _symfony-cache x-debugging:

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

For the ``assertHit`` and ``assertMiss`` assertions to work, you need to add
debug information in your AppCache. When running the tests, create the cache
kernel with the option ``'debug' => true`` and add the ``DebugListener``.

The ``UNDETERMINED`` state should never happen. If it does, it means that
something went really wrong in the kernel. Have a look at ``X-Symfony-Cache``
and at the HTML body of the response.
